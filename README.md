## Usage

### 1. Start the Container
If you wish to create data volumes, which will survive a restart or recreation of the container, please follow the instructions in [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage).

#### A. Basic Usage
Start the container:

* A named container ("spree")
* Ports 80, 443 (Nginx) and 3306 (MySQL port) exposed

As follows:

```no-highlight
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 3306:3306 --name spree dell/spree
```

<a name="advanced-usage"></a>
#### B. Advanced Usage
Start your container with:

* A named container ("spree")
* Ports 80, 443 (Nginx) and port 3306 (MySQL port) exposed
* Four data volumes (which will survive a restart or recreation of the container). The Spree application files are available in **/app** on the host. The Nginx website configuration files are available in **/data/nginx** on the host. The Nginx log files are available in **/var/log/nginx** on the host. The MySQL data is available in ***/data/mysql*** on the host.
* A predefined password for the MySQL admin user.

As follows:

```no-highlight
sudo docker run -d \
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 443:443 \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    -v /app:/app \
    -v /var/log/nginx:/var/log/nginx \
    -v /data/nginx:/opt/nginx/conf \
    -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
    -e MYSQL_PASS="mypass"  \
    --name spree dell/spree
```

## Check the Log Files

If you haven't defined a MySQL password, the container will generate a random one. Check the logs for the password by running:

```no-highlight
sudo docker logs spree
```

You will see output like the following:

```no-highlight
    ===================================================================
    You can now connect to this MySQL Server using:

        mysql -u admin -p47nnf4FweaKu -h<host> -P<port>

    Please remember to change the above password as soon as possible!
    MySQL user 'root' has no password but only allows local connections
    ===================================================================
```

In this case, **47nnf4FweaKu** is the password allocated to the admin user.

You can then connect to the admin console...
```no-highlight
mysql -u admin -p 47nnf4FweaKu --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3306
```

## Test your deployment

The Spree application can take some time to run due to scripts executed at start up but this usually is under a minute. You can check the progress by following the logs '**sudo docker logs --follow spree**' until the Nginx service is running.

To access the website, open:
```no-highlight
http://localhost
```
Or:

```no-highlight
https://localhost
```

The container supports SSL, via a self-signed certificate. **We strongly recommend that you connect via HTTPS**, if the container is running outside your local machine (e.g. in the Cloud). Your browser will warn you that the certificate is not trusted. If you are unclear about how to proceed, please consult your browser's documentation on how to accept the certificate.

Or with cURL:
```no-highlight
curl http://localhost
```

### Administration Web Console

The Spree administration console can be accessed by the below URL. Enter the admin default credentials username ```spree@example.com``` and password ```spree123```.

```no-highlight
http://localhost/admin
```

### Nginx Configuration

If you used the volume mapping option as listed in the [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage), you can directly change the Nginx configuration under **/data/nginx/** on the host. To restart the configuration, enter the container using [nsenter](https://github.com/dell-cloud-marketplace/additional-documentation/blob/master/nsenter.md), and do:

```no-highlight
supervisorctl restart nginx
```

As the Nginx service does a restart the child processes (Passenger) will also do a restart, spawning a new pid. Please note the below message will occur in the docker logs as a result:

```no-highlight
2014-12-16 12:15:38,083 CRIT reaped unknown pid 2806)
2014-12-16 12:15:38,085 CRIT reaped unknown pid 2811)
2014-12-16 12:15:39,118 CRIT reaped unknown pid 2842)
```

### Environment

The Spree application has been deployed to a development environment, details on environment settings for Phusion Passenger with Nginx and Spree are as follow:

* [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html#PassengerAppEnv)
* [Spree Deployment](https://guides.spreecommerce.com/developer/deployment_tips.html)
* [Ruby on Rails configuration](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html)

### Database Management

Spree database configuration details can be located from database.yml on the host if volume mapping is set up. If changes to the database are required the tool rake is used from within the container. Please use [nsenter](https://github.com/dell-cloud-marketplace/additional-documentation/blob/master/nsenter.md) to enter in the container. If you are a DCM user, please ssh into the instance. Rake commands are run from the ***/app*** directory.

### Customisation

Spree supports extensions that provide the facility to customise the Spree website, they can be found in the [Spree Extension Registry](http://spreecommerce.com/extensions). Extensions can be installed by adding it to the bottom of the Gemfile file (this resides in the project root folder ***/app*** which can be accessed from the host if volume mapping has been added). Further information on installing and existing alternatively creating your own is detailed from the [Spree Developers Guide](http://guides.spreecommerce.com/developer/extensions_tutorial.html). Any gems added to Gemfile will require the bundler to be run from directory ***/app*** from within the container via [nsenter](https://github.com/dell-cloud-marketplace/additional-documentation/blob/master/nsenter.md) or If you are a DCM user, please ssh into the instance.

To Do:
```no-highlight
 bundle install
 ```
 
Followed by copying the necessary migrations if it is an extension.
```no-highlight
bundle exec rails g gem_name:install
```
